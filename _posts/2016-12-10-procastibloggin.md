## Other day, other page

My **_#noshareDecember_** was on fire the first days, I had the help of a little [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji) the first 5 days having only 2 minutes to be in facebook was amazing, I realized that, actually you aren't missing anything, not being rude, but most of my facebook stream is only memes, posts against the goverment and funny videos, I wasn't missing any _news_, and I wasn't posting anything or sharing so I don't have any notification (mostly of my notifications are just **likes**, there isn't any debate or conversation).

My plan was to share everything that I need to share in this lovely and abandoned blog, I know that I missing a "back" button (just realized that is already implemented but in a lame text that say "home") and some kind of tags, to keep everything nice and clean, but at the moment I don't have enough content to be "messy", or something really important to be found, I said that will write a little about code, and probably bout **Processing**, but my lazyness is winning, besides that I'm drawing, drawing my silly comic and well playing **Monster Hunter**, add to that, I haven't tried properly the last update of the **OP1**.

## End of excuses

Well till now my no share december was promising, but then comes spiderman...

I'm a big spidey fan and well, that _tomorrow_ ended being me in front of youtube's landing page hitting **cmd+r** like a monkey, and then I turn off my extension and go back to _facebook_ and _twitter_ searching for answers, for knowledge, for **Tom Holland** dressed as the fucking spiderman!!!. after one day completely wasted I got the trailer:

And, yes, I'm super hyped, and well that's it, now I need to get organised to stop being so _social_ and do more drawings, music or code (not all at the same time, yet).
