_disclaimer: this isn't about Mad Max Fury Road, it's about the second part of the road trip through the south island, mini review of mad max, it's like Caffeine with Coke and Redbull for the eyes, E X P L O S I O N S._

## The journy continues

If you don't understand anything of what I'm talking, I suggest to read the previous entry [FURY ROAD I](http://dactrtr.rocks/Fury-Road/), If you still don't understand, sorry my english it no so goo.

**Christchurch** _the land of the eternal and really well paid jobs that everyone has except of you_, again 2/3 of the party has been already here in the past, and was our next stop after ending the **Fury Road Trip**, anyway guess who was that 1/3...

Akaroa was more fun, especially cuz _Jeremy_ was in a explosion of _french Emotions_, Akaroa is one of the First, or maybe the only, french Community and everything is writted in french, and it's full of _french flags_ of course I wish there were more **french girls** than flags, but life it's sad sometimes.
_more about Akaroa in it's own post_

### Dunedin

**STOP EVERYTHING** If you have speaked with me you should remember that I'm the less _my country is better than yours_ in this universe, but, **pls common** what's that shit about the **steppest road in the universe** in **Dunedin**, srsly where I was living in **Reñaca** I have to _climb_ a steppest road than this one, and I also run the damn thing to get tho class at time (that's the main reason why I fucked up my knees). I'm tired of your shit **Dunedin** get your shit together, _shualo_. **Kisses to all the ppl in Dunedin**

The town of the **Steampunk**, if you love the **Steampunk** life you will love this place, if not, well yo can skip this town, there's also a **Steampunk museum**. Did I say the **Steampunk** word enough times.

### Bluff

_The southest south southering southtown in town_, yes it's at the really south, and that's all, I even think there's no people in this place, well if the _luck_ it's with you, maybe the **Aurora Australis** will appear in front of you, if not, you can go to this **amazing space bathroom** where you only have ten minutes to _drop the mole_.

### Fiordland

The only thing to tell of this place, besides _it's beautiful bla bla bla_ it's that at this point we ditched the old and comfy tent for **2 persons** for a luxury **4 persons** tent, so we set up the tent, get comfy, good night fellas...

> What time is it?

Jèrèmy

Yes we are ready to sleep at **4PM**, so this was the **longest night of our lives**, also one of the coldest night ever, and we know that, cuz **Jèrèmy** was slowly during the night coming from his side to **MY SIDE**, passing through **Jure Side** so at morning we are at the same space that in the old _notsocomfytent_.

and that's all of our... **NO** surprise at the next morning when we try to get into the car, **SURPRISE** the car was [FROZEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU), so the longest night get more longer...

I will love to have more pictures or even a video, but also my iPhone was [FROZEN](https://youtu.be/YLaVe3DopJ8?t=2m10s).

The car get also stuck in the mud, twice, and well I fell in the mud, but with the help of some **French** dudes, we can go away and went to the last spot...

### Queenstown

Look there's a **Foursquare** in Queenstown and it's **Fucking** **expensive**, also a lot of **expensive** stuff to do.
**E X P E N S I V E**.

Next stop... Christchurch but there will be no post for that, because **AKAROA ROCKS**.
