## A more human approach

I will _try_ to make not only ugly posts about `code` cuz:

- nobody cares, neither about my blog nor the `code`
- I don't have enough knowledge to put something seriously important about **html, css, processing, swift** or another thing that I have tried.

Maybe I can write about **drawing** or **design**, nothing new but at least from my distorted point of view... **less bla bla bla** and more about life.
As all my old post are lost in the deeps or a json file I will try to do a mini catch up with my life:

Last year I was working in a videogame company **DeNA** (as a UI artist) the project where was working _fail_ and by the cold cut of the **headcount** get fired. One of my friend at that time was planning to get the **wh** and come to **new zealand**.

He told me about his evil plan, and for me was an excellent way of do something new.

I worked in a couple of projects while prepared everything for the **journey** part of that preparation was get rid of my **six years** of dreadlocks, still miss them. Learn a little of **swift**, buy a new [sketchbook](http://www.jetpens.com/Midori-Traveler-s-Notebook-Refill-Passport-Size-Blank-MD-Paper/pd/13640) and a couple (10) of [pencils](http://www.ebay.com/itm/MoMa-MUJI-Gel-Ink-Ball-Point-Pen-0-38mm-Black-color-10pcs-/170984994968).
I will skip all the _thiscountryissodifferent_ and go to the core:

### Tauranga

Tauranga was my _HQ_ and intel place, here I can finally get my bank account and mi IRD account, two basic thing that Auckland denied me during two weeks. Make some friends and start to live the nightmare of working in a packhouse during 2 months.

### Palmerston North

Wasn't easy to get to _palmy_ and fuck! What a cold place, but was nice to see and [old friend](http://miguel.co.nz/blog) and a really cool place to work (**I HOPE**).

The _magical_ and **RAD** town of blenheim, actually wasn't so radical or magical, or anything ended in _ical_, was pretty boring, in fact the **cool place in town** was _The Yard_ were the most fun thing was walk to the pub, and the walk back to the Backpacker, always with _The Js_, Jeremy and Jure.
Also went to play **Paintball** with a great friend Charlotte, amazing times fixing her computer and showing my nerd knowing power.

### FURY ROAD trip

This deserves its own post, so I'll make _supershortversion_, after **developing** a friendship with _the Js_ we decided to go in a roadtrip to the south island, actuallly they invited me cuz "will be so funny be with you".

### Queenstown

The end of the **Fury road trip**, we spent a week doing nothing, not even all the fun and _expensive_ things that has to offer **Queenstown**, no wait, we search for gold, and a job, and guess who didn't find either of those.

### Christchurch

**ChC** the Job promised land, where everyone can find a job, make a lot of money, and live the **Working Holiday Dreamlife** or in our case, the land of the mercenary jobs, kind of well paids, and the Ultimate experience of **survive a real fire in our hotel** and stay outside for 4 hours in the cold watching how the hotel throw smoke for the windows while you think that the only thing that have with you are a shitty phone and your pants.
