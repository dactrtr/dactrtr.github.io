## Blogging is hard

This is actually _my first_ post in the blog, at the beggining I was **thinking** about write about which _plugins_ I used, or _how I migrate all the post_ from [Ghost](http://ghost.org) to [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) but of course, not everything went out as I _expected_.

This is me trying to handle all this code.

I was like that picture, cuz I just jumped from the step of **FORK** the repo, to *dive inside the sass and the cool plugins in ruby* without read **anything**.
Usually I'm that kind of humans that the first thing they do is **read** the *fucking* manual, but not this time, so I ended learning how the plugins works (actually there's like 5 supported plugins) and also how sass works with the mixins in the *hard* way, Exploding everything, was really a pain in the *codeass* see the [many ways](https://css-tricks.com/approaches-media-queries-sass/) that you can put a simple `mediaqueries` in the **sass** files.

Me now, after 3 hours of trying to fix the things, 3 commit/merge mistakes, and after deleted the blog, re uploaded, and merged all the CSS by hand...

Besides my dumbness, when I was looking at the `json` file, that makes [Ghost](http://ghost.org) when you use the export option in *labs*, **surprise** it's totally non human readable, yes, I'm a human and not able to read that kind of **shit**...

So playing the _smart guy_, mounted back my **local Ghost** and manually copy paste the content of each post, wasn't the best idea ever but at least sound like a exit to the problem...

One thing kids, when you are using features that are under the category **labs** it's pretty common that... well... FAIL, yep, I get and error from the `json`so I "LOST" all my previous post, nothing important really. Now I must **CSSING** the blog for mobile and fix another couple of things...

But seems that from now on, will be quite _easy_.
Later in a next _amazing_ post maybe I will speak more about this wilderness that's making a blog.

Now I need to piss, I have been in front of the computer like **centuries**.
