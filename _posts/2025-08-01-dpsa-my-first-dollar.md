# The demo is alive

Yes its true, this last July I went to the bitSummit 2025 and met a fellow Playdate developers, and show them my game, even tho wasnt completely done, amd they didnt play more than 5 minutes they love it, and encourage me to release a demo, and I did.

## itchi.io

The demo is in itchio, didnt make much noise about it, kinda shadow dropped it, and call it a day. To be honest wanted to focus in the unity game, so this demo was more of a close event, a moment were I can let it go and move on.

## surprise

To my surprise, some one paid for the demo, never thought someone was willing to pay for my game.
