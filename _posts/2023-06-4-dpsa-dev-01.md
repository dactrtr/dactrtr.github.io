# Shooting Stars

One part that isn't even defined in my game but I know its a MUST its a **shooting mini-game**, I mean, if you are in a spaceship and you can't shoot its a **boring game**, specially when the main idea of your game its being a rail shooter.

So my approach was _easy_, I just need to draw on screen the **lasers** and the **ship**, nothing hard, for this ill define the position of each shooter and then set the end of the line to the center of the **crosshair**. With a little of parameters magic and simple math, like really simple. _Pium_ _Pium_.

## Setting up

First I created **3 objects**, a ship, a crosshair and a "mini" ship all of them react to the d-pad movement, the ship just rotates and change the asset depending of the button you press, and the crosshair just moves around the screen.

For the crosshair I set simple conditions to make it back to the center of the screen, its literally a counter backwards that change the position to the center, not even when you release the button, its always going back to the center. At this point I was thinking of having a big picture of the ship as part of the UI, so when you receive damage you see it directly in the ship Illustration, cool idea but add a lot of asset creation and took a bunch of screen space just for nothing, maybe I'll re implement this idea in a different way later. but for this iteration **DELETED**.

## Shooting

In theory making the ship shooting was gonna be easy, for the start wanted something easy so a straight line was going to be more than enough, so, I just grab the center position of the crosshair, each of the shooter positions, and draw a line between each of those points, for making it disappear I took the **worst approach ever**. the laser its draw every frame, but with a _clear_ color, and when you press the button the color changes, and when the button its released the color changes to _clear_ again. Kinda a smart way to do it but really **CPU** and **RAM** consuming. Also the laser was being rendered on top of the ship.

Wrong Z-index my friend.

Since the solution wasn't as easy as just change the Z-index, opted for drawing in a separate image and assign that image to a sprite, which gave me more methods and access to the **Z-index**, for this just made a _test_ entity were it draws a circle every time I press the button and paint it back to _clear_ on release, here comes more bugs.

Well problem solved, now just need to do the same with the lasers instead of the **unfunny sun**...

As you can see the lasers weren't **clearing** themselves, so new approach, this time with [timers](https://sdk.play.date/1.13.7/Inside%20Playdate.html#C-frameTimer), which also allows me to create _charging_ lasers, so this time after a few frames the lasers disappears, **problem solved, un solved, and resolved.**

Also added some _FX_ to the shooting, but gonna change it cuz you can barely see it. I almost forgot that for the moving shooter starting position had to add some modifiers to the calculation according to the position of the ship. Next step its create a "galaxy" to create movement.

I tend to say a lot of "easy", when isn't that "easy" but it's my toxic trait to simplify everything I do when isn't that easy or simple.
