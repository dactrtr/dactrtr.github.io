# Shooting Stars

One part that isn't even defined in my game but I know its a MUST its a shooting mini-game, I mean, if you are in a spaceship and you can't shoot its a boring game, specially when the main idea of your game its being a rail shooter.

So my approach was easy, I just need to draw on screen the lasers and the ship, nothing hard, for this ill define the position of each shooter and then set the end of the line to the center of the crosshair. with a little of parameters magic and simple math, like really simple.

First I created 3 objects, a ship, a crosshair and a "mini" ship all of them react to the d-pad movement, the ship just rotates and change the asset depending of the button you press, and the crosshair just moves around the screen.

For the crosshair I set simple conditions to make it back to the center of the screen, its literally a counter backwards that change the position to the center, not even when you release the button, its always going back to the center. At this point I was thinking of having a big picture of the ship as part of the UI, so when you receive damage you see it directly in the ship Illustration, cool idea but add a lot of asset creation and took a bunch of screen space just for nothing, maybe I'll re implement this idea in a different way later. but for this **DELETED**
