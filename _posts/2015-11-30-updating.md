## Why resuming it's important

When I'm talking about resuming I looking at **you** Appstore, a few weeks ago quit my job, and I've been updating my _design stuffs_, like making this blog, catching up with a few things about the internet, etc, etc.

And one of the things that I was **Updating**, was **xcode**, with the new version _7.1.1_ now you can run your projects in your **iDevice** without having a _developer account_, that's great for the _poor and creative_ ppl like me who aren't ready to pay for a developer account but wish to see how that little experiment behaves in a real _device_.

Everything's good, and nice, till we get to the point of the _shitty_ internet that you have in a backpacker, even having a free _wi fi_ it's like a gift, were am now, we have little _internet vouchers_ of **500mb**, that means, **I NEED A BUNCH OF VOUCHERS TO DOWNLOAD THE 4.3 GB** that xcode need, and also, keep watching the download, to stop it, get another voucher, login, re-start the download, repeat... well this is the second time that I start to do another **thing** (like the blog) and I miss the _"change voucher moment"_.

_And SURPRISE_ **APPSTORE DOESN'T RESUME THE DOWNLOADS** thanks **apple** for nothing.
