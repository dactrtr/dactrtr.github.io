_disclaimer: this isn't about Mad Max Fury Road, it's about the road trip through the south island, mini review of mad max, it's like Caffeine for the eyes, just amazing._

## We laugh, we die, and we laugh again

First I want to start with this video that's pretty much what was all this epic journey...

 I have to confess that I have **no frickin idea** of which places we visit, I was only a picture-asian-monkey, and also I'm really *bad with names*. So I can't be specific saying *tinkukurapomimu* it's an amazing place, also because that place doesn't exist, I think.
 
### The Raiders

In the eternal randomness of life we meet in **Blenheim**, with **Jeremy** working at the _pine trees_ and he introduces **Jure** to the party (yeah like the _RPG parties_) at the beginning wasn't part of my plans to travel, not even now, at that point was, staying in Blenheim till they say me:

> Sebastian we don't need you anymore

My thoughs

But one day at the **best place of Blenheim**, Domino's Pizza , this couple of _pseudo humans_ told me... _You can come with us in our ROAD TRIP, it will be really funny travel with you_

So yes, it's not because I'm a good person or my _amazing survival skills_ (in [Don't Starve](https://www.kleientertainment.com/games/dont-starve)), was only because **I CAN MAKE FUCKIN PEOPLE LAUGH**...

fair enough, also it's true.

### DA TRIP

**Kiss kiss, good bye Blenheim** and we depart to **Nelson**, one of the Highlights of our self called **fury** road **trip** besides doing it fast, was, **Gold searching**

### Nelson

In **Nelson**, **Nelson** like the real **Nelson**, nothing happen so let's move to the important... the gold.

So you are into the gold searching? well you can't miss this amazing lesson about Goldfinding with the Young goldpadawan **Jeremy** and the master GoldJedi **Jure** and me as the cameraman, this is your first step into the big world of being rich only waving a plate.

_This is a really lame edition of the video, I will Blame Canada as always._

Of course we didn't find anything beside Sheeps, Lambs, Cows, and roads, a lot of damn long roads, well and Chicken in a can the best food you can buy for ~3 dollars.

After **Nelson** we went to **Greymouth**, or this it's what the _gps data_ of my pictures says, and we stay for the first night in the **wilderness**, 3 guys in one tent for... 2 persons...

### Arthur pass

[I should post a picture but, you wanna see a picture of my shitty Herthstone deck?](https://twitter.com/Dactrtr/status/669629793671876608)

This was our first stop were we behave like monkeys without any kind of technology, we went out of the car and start to plug our cellphones, and everything that uses a battery, also we had a little **FREE WIFI SPOT** so me and Jeremy ended playing **Hearthstone** in the middle of the cafe.

Brace yourselves! cuz there still more adventures to tell, in the **next post**...
