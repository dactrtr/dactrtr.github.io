# I'm Broken

That's what _my blog_ was saying to me for **MONTHS**, and as a good human being I always blame others instead of myself.

> "ahh it's Docker, it's the M1, it's the C thingies installed, the branch it's broken, it's this or that"

"yo" that's me in Spanish

Well wasn't that, was **me**, trying to fix something that wasn't broken, try to add things unnecessary to something that was already working, here you can realize that I'm a designer and not a developer, first rule of development "don't fix something that isn't broken", well

## The Real life

ahh yes I also broke myself in real life, this year has been a hell or a ride, I think did more things in just one year than the last two or three, let me elaborate on this.

For doing things easily we are gonna take this ride per month, with a little resume.

### December

_Two days before the year ended_ I managed to settle my life goals, after two years of covid, managed to get a remote job, so I can start _travel_, my goal of travel wasn't just for the sake of traveling, I wanted to go and meet a friend, so I grab my backpack, a really bad selection of items, I'm looking at you camera sitting in the desk, and took a flight of 35 hours to... **Sri Lanka** (at this point I have to add that I don't know how to _swim_, don't like _beaches_, and definitely don't like _warm weather_)

### January

Things were going _smoothly sweaty_, getting used to the humidity, work in a different timezone, hanging out with my "_friend_" (at this point you should have guessed) her friends and the new ppl, started to go to the ocean, and spend time in the beach, leave your comfort zone ppl says, I was totally in my _uncomfort_ zone, did I say I was eating mostly fruits, things I never ate, also, in **Sri Lanka** almost everything is made with **coconut**, something I always hated till now.

### February

At this point I was a fruit devouring animal, all my meals were based on coconut and even managed to get a coconut from the palm, opened it and used it for meals completely. Also was traveling all **Sri Lanka** with my not s just _friend_ anymore and more _girlfriend_, at this point everything seems going **amazing**, traveling a paradisiacal Island, eating healthy, doing new stuff, working remotely, life it's good...

Wait its a _joke_ that **Russia** Bombed **Ukraine** right? it's 2022 this kind of things not happen right? right?

> "but dude, not big deal, you are from Chile right?"

friends from **Ukraine**, and my GF it's **Ukrainian**...

Also got fired, but didn't care, at that point means that I could shift my focus to **BF mode** and learn new things(SwiftUI & LUA)

And by mistake I throw my iPad to my Macbook and broke my screen.

### March

Here things start to get **bad and dizzy**, the next months where just harder and harder, 6 days into March and we crashed our **tuk tuk**, nothing terrible happened to us, the **tuk tuk** was wasted, this wasn't the first accident, the first day I drive it, flipped it, that moment was just scary but really nothing happened, this time we got some injuries, nothing serious, gotta admit that I got the "worse" part, and im glad, don't mind having a few scars. A few days later her computer broke, so I handed her mine and kept studying from the iPad.

During March I kinda loss interest in "_work_", or at least working for someone else. And started to spend my "**working hours**" into learning **SwiftUI** and at that point determined to become a _iOS developer_ and at some point make my own game(since January was spending a little of time in the [playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/).

At the end of the month we managed to get my screen replaced, and checked my GF computer, but we didn't fix hers.

### April

April _wasn't_ better at all, the **war** didn't look like was going to stop, since Chile has a lot of shit against the states _saw a lot of ppl kinda supporting Russia_, kinda, the **stress** in the relationship keep growing, after the accident _we didn't receive any kind of support more than by ourselves_, and my BF role kinda use most of my time, or at least its how it felt, **the accident**, **the war**, **the broken computer**, _my insecurities_, _and two years of being in isolation didn't help_, not blaming anyone but at the moment there was a lot of things _I could have done better_. We extend our Visas so we can stay more time in **Sri Lanka**, which at this point was having some political and social situation.

During April I received a Job offer, the _latino spirit_ was killing me after being without an income for couple of months, and in some weird way thought that, maybe having a job will make things better, even tho I didn't have my computer and "timezones", well the project it's cool, the team it's cool, anyways, **it was a better idea than I thought**.

Finished the [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), and started reading about Combine.

### May

After our **wounds started to heal** and our mood was _kinda better_, we decided to move to **Turkey**, since was a _closer country to Ukraine and still not in the Schengen area_ and things started to getting worse and worse in **Sri Lanka** so was a no brainer to move, maybe we just need some fresh air of a new city. At the beginning things were better but _some things_ still were off. She moved back home, and I went to France to visit my cousin.

During this time she was working on my computer while I manage to deliver my tasks working from the iPad (most of the time).

### June

The first days of June were hard, the relationship ended (not gonna explain here, but as wrote before _I could have done better a lot of things_).

Went to Paris, stayed in Chamonix, saw my friends (they travelled to Chamonix), ate a lot of pizza.

### July

Nothing happened, just sorrow and lone lines, guilty and thinking, **war** didn't stop, and was worrying without being able to do much. The award for the worst month of 2022 goes to July, FY July.

Besides that since I was in the _Schengen Area_ had to think for a place to go, outside the Schengen and try to "re plan" my life, at this point was lonely and without a plan so...

### August

My plan was at some point going to Austria to see the [KrampusRummel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus), so I needed to leave the _Schengen_ and make the dates fit to be able to be back at the end of November, kinda make a plan and decided to go to Bulgaria for a few months, specifically to **Bansko**, the land of the **Digital nomads**.

Things seems to be better, till I had an accident and cut my finger, lots of blood, and kinda **cut** all my "let's meet ppl mood and enjoy the life for a few weeks", besides was right hand so also kinda crippled me a little.

### September

Was mostly staying in **Bansko** and moving to **Sofia** a couple of times to buy things or go to another places, like **Plovdiv**, love Plovdiv. Made a few new good friends.

### October

Finger was kinda better, still numb, but already the wound was closed. Went to Italy to see a friend, had great times, moved to Romania, Timisoara.

### November

Moved to **Salzburg**, Austria enjoyed the **Christmas markets** and the **Krampus**, at this point gotta say that my two goals of the year were accomplished. Something good.

### December

Moved to Porto, Portugal, to visit a very good friend and spend xmas and new years eve. During all this months kept learning Lua and SwiftUI. Damn food in Portugal it's _unbelievable_ tasty.

---

## Now

It's **Dec 22th** I'm writing this from my friend's couch, planning my next year, were I'll travel, working, gotta say that the best of the month was February, or at least the first quarter of the month, really enjoyed traveling Sri Lanka, and mostly the company, really wish thing would end differently, but that's life.

My elbow still looks like shit from the **tuk tuk crash**, and my finger still feels numb, its really hard to grab things from small pockets and the part that isn't numb feels _funny_ most of the times.

Gotta say that at some point felt as broken and my blog, and kept blaming others, and again, as with my blog, the blame was on _me_.
