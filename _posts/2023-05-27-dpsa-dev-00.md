# DinoPirates from Outer Space VS the Evil Brocolliens from inner space

Yup, indeed and in fact, this it's a long name for a game, and its even funnier than its a **long** name for a game for a really _small_ console, The Playdate, let me introduce you this small and beautiful piece of tech:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HdF3CnFvxg4?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Probably you have no idea what I'm talking about, or to be honest you are the _few friends_ that visit my blog and you know exactly what im talking about, the playdate **it's the console that I've been waiting for years**, literally cuz the _shipping delays_, but also cuz looks so cute and has a really _approachable SDK_ and develop method, ok Unity could be easy, but with so much freedom comes [The Paradox of Choice](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice), so a more contained environment it's great for **me** and this little idea.

## Dinowhat?

This started really quickly, a friend came with the idea of some dinosaurs in space, and they are pirates, that was more than enough for my brain to pickup and start growing this universe really fast, not fast enough to have a decent story but enough speed to [make a few pages comic](https://tapas.io/episode/521805), and have a simple idea of a universe in my mind.

And that idea got reborn, when I saw the playdate and start to play around with the [SDK](https://play.date/dev/) wanted to make a game but didn't knew about what, and remember my fellow pirates.

I'm ~~still not~~ completely sold in the **gameplay** idea ~~or~~ but not in the **story** itself, I just have this [comic](https://tapas.io/episode/521805), some assets, and some designs, let me show it.

## Sketchs

This is a bunch of draws, and sketches I did for the main character, also have a few of them for the ships but that im gonna add them in a second post.

From sketches, to pixelart assets to more "serious" versions of the same character.

If you **check the comic** you will realize that the main character changed from a _Styracosaurs_ to a _Triceratops_, this is mainly cuz the Triceratops its more **easy to draw at small scales**, even tho, the main design still contains some features of a _Styracosaurs_, so its kinda of a mix.

All started with this, a lonely dinopirate in a room fill with brocoalien rats.

My main game its just **two** screens, the one on the image above, thats the dinosaur in a room fill with **broco-enemies**, where I tried and learn how to make some collisions and get some basic interactions, and the second one a screen that's a little more of a gameplay...

pium pium shooting game.

And for the main gameplay we (yes we are making a Studio with some friends) think a mix of _Starfox_ and _Starlink_, some kinda of traveling around the galaxy fixing things and also a rail shooter with a bunch of nonsense jokes.

My next goal its create some story for the game, and add the [Panels library](https://github.com/cadin/panels) to the game to have a vertical slice of the game with some in **game cinematics**. And also change how the _UI_ works.
