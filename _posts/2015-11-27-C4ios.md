## Drop da Bomb

Hey little fellas, if you **know me** you should remember that I'm a guy pretty interested in all this _creative coding_ stuff, yes you're right like [Processing](http://processing.org) or like [Openframeworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) and another languages that actually never learn anything. Lately last year I was sunken in the deeps of [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/) so my process of design apps would be more complete, and I think **swift** is really "easy" to understand, at least the basics to make some prototyping.

A couple of days ago I read about this new _framework_ called [C4](http://www.c4ios.com/) that's sound very cool, of course after reading the words _creative coding_ in the site I decided to give it a try...

This _framework_ isn't new, actually it's from the 2012, and it's mainly focused in media and multitouch, and focused only in _iOS devices_, there are some videos of experiments and art installations in ther [Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/c4ios) that look really good.

#### C4

    C4ViewAnimation(duration: 0.5) {
        shape.center = self.canvas.center
        shape.lineWidth = 5
    }.animate()

#### SWIFT

    UIView.animateWithDuration(0.5) {
        shape.center = self.canvas.center
    }

    CATransaction.begin()
    CATransaction.setValue(NSNumber(float: 0.5), forKey: kCATransactionAnimationDuration)
    shape.lineWidth = 5
    CATransaction.commit()

Actually the structure of the code is pretty simple and in the site itself they teach you how to make and app with the language, pretty cool ain't ya?

The interactions of the app looks really _complex_ to do with _normal_ code, or at least a lot of lines of code, yesterday after a little **fight with xcode** I made to try a little the basics of **C4** and with my _not so vast_ knowledge I give it my seal off approval, soon will try to do something and give a more deep review or just saying that I put it aside for _reasons_ like I just did with **processing** and **OF**.

pd: actually my problem with processing is that isn't easy to export your _sketches_ to a **iOS** device, but that doesn't mean that's not in my heart <2.
